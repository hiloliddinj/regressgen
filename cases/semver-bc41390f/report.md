Subclassing `Version` and comparing instances gives inconsistent results depending on which side is the subclass.

```python
from semver import Version

class MyVersion(Version):
    pass

a = MyVersion.parse("1.0.0")
b = Version.parse("1.0.0")

print(a.compare(b))   # blows up with a TypeError instead of returning 0
print(b.compare(a))   # this direction works fine, returns 0

print(a == b)  # False, even though they represent the same version
print(b == a)  # True
```

So `a.compare(b)` raises a TypeError, while `b.compare(a)` returns 0 as expected. Same asymmetry shows up with `==`: `a == b` and `b == a` don't agree, which breaks the usual assumption that equality is symmetric.

I'd expect comparing a `Version` with an instance of a subclass to behave the same regardless of which one is on the left side of the comparison — either both should succeed and agree, or if subclass comparison genuinely isn't supported, both directions should fail/return NotImplemented consistently rather than one working and one raising.
