Using `unittest.mock.create_autospec` on a class that has a `cachedmethod`-decorated method blows up with an AttributeError instead of just producing a mock.

Repro:

```python
import unittest.mock
from cachetools import cachedmethod, LRUCache

class Cached:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = LRUCache(maxsize=10)

    @cachedmethod(lambda self: self.cache)
    def get(self, key):
        return key

unittest.mock.create_autospec(Cached, instance=True)
```

This raises an AttributeError coming from deep inside the descriptor logic while `unittest.mock` is introspecting the class attributes (it appears mock passes an instance of `None` when checking things like `iscoroutinefunction` on class-level attributes). Any class with a cached method fails autospeccing this way, which makes it awkward to write mocks/tests for classes that use `cachedmethod`.

Expected: `create_autospec` should work normally (or at least not throw) on classes using `cachedmethod`, same as it does for plain methods.
