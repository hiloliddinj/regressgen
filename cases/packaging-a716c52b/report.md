When `dynamic` in metadata includes a disallowed field like `name`, `version`, or `metadata-version`, accessing `.dynamic` raises `InvalidMetadata`, but the error message prints the whole list instead of telling me which field was actually the problem.

```python
from packaging import metadata

meta = metadata.Metadata.from_raw({"dynamic": ["name"]}, validate=False)
meta.dynamic
```

This raises something like:

```
packaging.metadata.InvalidMetadata: ['name'] is not allowed as a dynamic field
```

If `dynamic` has more than one entry, it's not obvious which one triggered the error just from reading the message - I have to go figure it out myself. I'd expect the error to name the specific offending field (e.g. `'name' is not allowed as a dynamic field`), not dump the whole list back at me. Minor, but it makes debugging metadata files with several dynamic fields more annoying than it needs to be.
