`running_min` and `running_max` don't seem to preserve which element was actually picked when values compare equal but have different types. Since Python's builtin `min`/`max` are stable (return the first argument when equal), I'd expect the running versions to behave the same way, but they don't.

```python
from fractions import Fraction
import more_itertools as mi

data = [0, 0.0, Fraction(0)]
print(list(map(type, mi.running_min(data, maxlen=2))))
# [<class 'int'>, <class 'float'>, <class 'fractions.Fraction'>]

print([type(min(data[0:1])), type(min(data[0:2])), type(min(data[1:3]))])
# [<class 'int'>, <class 'int'>, <class 'float'>]
```

The types returned by `running_min` don't match what plain `min` would give for the same windows, even though all the values are numerically equal. Same issue shows up with `running_max`. I expected the running versions to pick the same element (and thus same type) as the builtin would for equal values, since that's usually relied on for identity-preserving behavior, not just numeric comparison.
