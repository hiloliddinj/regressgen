`TTLCache.expire()` returns `None` instead of something iterable, which makes it impossible to actually see which items got expired. I was expecting to get back the expired key/value pairs so I could do some cleanup logic based on them, but instead I get `None` and any attempt to iterate over it blows up.

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from cachetools import TTLCache

cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1, ttl=timedelta(days=1), timer=datetime.now)
cache[1] = 1

items = cache.expire(datetime.now() + timedelta(days=1))
list(items)  # TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable
```

I expected `expire()` to give back something I could iterate over (even if empty) representing whatever was removed, not `None`. Right now the only way to know what expired is to diff the cache contents before/after myself, which seems like it shouldn't be necessary given the method is presumably doing that work already.
