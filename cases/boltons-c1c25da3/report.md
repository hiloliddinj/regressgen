`Bits` doesn't validate that the given value actually fits in the given bit length — it lets a value equal to `2 ** len_` through, which produces a `Bits` object that's silently one bit longer than requested instead of raising.

```python
from boltons.mathutils import Bits

Bits(3, 2).as_bin()   # '11', fine, this is the largest value that fits in 2 bits

Bits(4, 2).as_bin()   # I expected a ValueError here since 4 doesn't fit in 2 bits
                       # but instead it returns something with more than 2 bits

Bits(1, 0)             # same issue, 1 doesn't fit in 0 bits but no error is raised
```

I'd expect `Bits(value, len_)` to raise a `ValueError` whenever `value` can't actually be represented in `len_` bits (i.e. when it's too big), rather than quietly accepting it and returning a longer bit string than asked for. Right now the boundary check seems to be off by one, since the largest legitimately-fitting value works correctly but the next value up (which shouldn't fit) is also accepted.
